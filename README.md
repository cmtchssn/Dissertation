Unity VR Audio Dissertation Materials

### Day 001
Set up a dissertation repo with .gitignore for Unity and Windows. Installed Unity Hub and the latest version of Unity (2019.1.5f1). Created a Unity project using the 3D with Extras template. Followed instructions [here](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-git-with-unity) to set up git with Unity, ammend Unity's version control, and use git large file storage. I built a 6-plane room and a cube in the main scene. I still need to access a VR kit, download the SDK, apply that to my Unity project.
